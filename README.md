# Voice Agent × Apple Calendar Backend

Connects your ElevenLabs voice agent to a user's Apple (iCloud) Calendar via CalDAV.
Handles two flows:

1. **Trigger a call** — your backend tells ElevenLabs to call the user.
2. **Live tool calls** — while on the call, the agent hits your webhooks to create/list/update/delete calendar events.

## 1. Get an Apple app-specific password (required — real Apple ID password won't work)

1. Go to https://appleid.apple.com → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords
2. Generate one, copy it (format `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`)
3. Put it, plus the Apple ID email, into `.env`

## 2. Set up `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in APPLE_ID, APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
# ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID, ELEVENLABS_AGENT_PHONE_NUMBER_ID, TOOL_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

`TOOL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — make up any long random string. This is what protects your
`/tools/*` endpoints from being called by anyone other than ElevenLabs.

`ELEVENLABS_AGENT_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` — you get this after importing a Twilio number
into ElevenLabs (Phone Numbers tab) and linking it to your agent.

## 3. Install & run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Expose it publicly for ElevenLabs to reach (during dev, use ngrok):

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

## 4. Configure the ElevenLabs agent's Server Tools

In the ElevenLabs dashboard, on your agent → **Tools** → **Add Tool** → **Webhook**,
create these four, each pointing at your public URL + path below, method `POST`,
with a custom header `X-Webhook-Secret: <your TOOL_WEBHOOK_SECRET>` on every one.

### `list_events`
`POST https://<your-ngrok-domain>/tools/list-events`
Body params (let the LLM fill these from conversation):
- `start_iso` (string, required) — e.g. `2026-07-25T00:00:00`
- `end_iso` (string, required) — e.g. `2026-07-26T00:00:00`

Use this before booking, so the agent can check for conflicts and offer real slots.

### `create_event`
`POST https://<your-ngrok-domain>/tools/create-event`
- `summary` (string, required)
- `start_iso` (string, required)
- `end_iso` (string, required)
- `description` (string, optional)
- `location` (string, optional)

### `update_event`
`POST https://<your-ngrok-domain>/tools/update-event`
- `uid` (string, required) — the agent should have this from a prior create/list call in the same conversation
- `summary`, `start_iso`, `end_iso`, `description`, `location` (all optional)

### `delete_event`
`POST https://<your-ngrok-domain>/tools/delete-event`
- `uid` (string, required)

**System prompt tip:** tell the agent explicitly to call `list_events` first when
booking/rescheduling to check for conflicts, and to keep track of the `uid`
returned by `create_event`/`list_events` in conversation memory so it can
reference it later in the same call for updates/cancellations.

## 5. Trigger an outbound call

From your own backend/cron/CRM webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-ngrok-domain>/calls/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to_number": "+919812345678",
    "customer_name": "Rohan",
    "reason": "Following up on your plumbing quote request"
  }'
```

`customer_name` and `reason` are passed to the agent as dynamic variables — use
`{{customer_name}}` / `{{reason}}` in your agent's first message / system prompt
in the ElevenLabs dashboard to personalize the call.

## Notes / next steps

- **Multi-user**: right now credentials are one hardcoded account in `.env`.
  When you're ready to support many users, replace `app/config.py`'s Apple
  fields with a lookup (DB) keyed by `user_id`, and pass `user_id` as a
  dynamic variable at call-trigger time so ElevenLabs includes it in every
  tool call back to you (add it as a parameter on each tool, or as a header
  via a `secret__user_id` dynamic variable).
- **Timezones**: `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` is applied to any ISO datetime without
  explicit tz info. Adjust in `.env` if needed.
- **Encrypt credentials at rest** once you move to a real DB — app-specific
  passwords are still sensitive.
